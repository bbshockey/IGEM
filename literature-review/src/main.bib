title = {Survival of Escherichia coli in Manure-Amended Soils Is Affected by Spatiotemporal, Agricultural, and Weather Factors in the Mid-Atlantic United States},
volume = {85},
year = {2019},
abstract = {Untreated biological soil amendments of animal origin (BSAAO), such as manure, are commonly used to fertilize soils for growing fruit and vegetable crops and can contain enteric bacterial foodborne pathogens. Little is known about the comparative longitudinal survival of pathogens in agricultural fields containing different types of BSAAO, and field data may be useful to determine intervals between manure application and harvest of produce intended for human consumption to minimize foodborne illness. This study generated 324 survival profiles from 12 different field trials at three different sites (UMES, PA, and BARC) in the Mid-Atlantic United States from 2011 to 2015 of inoculated nonpathogenic
(gEc) and attenuated O157
(attO157) in soils which were unamended (UN) or amended with untreated poultry litter (PL), horse manure (HM), or dairy manure solids (DMS) or liquids (DML). Site, season, inoculum level (low/high), amendment type, management (organic/conventional), and depth (surface/tilled) all significantly (
 < 0.0001) influenced survival duration (dpi100mort). Spatiotemporal factors (site, year, and season) in which the field trial was conducted influenced survival durations of gEc and attO157 to a greater extent than weather effects (average daily temperature and rainfall). Initial soil moisture content was the individual factor that accounted for the greatest percentage of variability in survival duration. PL supported greater survival durations of gEc and attO157, followed by HM, UN, and DMS in amended soils. The majority of survival profiles for gEc and attO157 which survived for more than 90 days came from a specific year (i.e., 2013). The effect of management and depth on dpi100mort were dependent on the amendment type evaluated.
Current language in the Food Safety Modernization Act Produce Safety Rule states no objection to a 90- or 120-day interval between application of untreated BSAAO and harvest of crops to minimize transfer of pathogens to produce intended for human consumption with the intent to limit potential cases of foodborne illness. This regional multiple season, multiple location field trial determined survival durations of
in soils amended with manure to determine whether this interval is appropriate. Spatiotemporal factors influence survival durations of
more than amendment type, total amount of
present, organic or conventional soil management, and depth of manure application. Overall, these data show poultry litter may support extended survival of
compared to horse manure or dairy manure, but spatiotemporal factors like site and season may have more influence than manure type in supporting survival of
beyond 90 days in amended soils in the Mid-Atlantic United States.},

volume = {40},
year = {2020},
abstract = {This study aimed at developing a predictive model that captures the influences of a variety of agricultural and environmental variables and is able to predict the concentrations of enteric bacteria in soil amended with untreated Biological Soil Amendments of Animal Origin (BSAAO) under dynamic conditions. We developed and validated a Random Forest model using data from a longitudinal field study conducted in mid‐Atlantic United States investigating the survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and generic E. coli in soils amended with untreated dairy manure, horse manure, or poultry litter. Amendment type, days of rain since the previous sampling day, and soil moisture content were identified as the most influential agricultural and environmental variables impacting concentrations of viable E. coli O157:H7 and generic E. coli recovered from amended soils. Our model results also indicated that E. coli O157:H7 and generic E. coli declined at similar rates in amended soils under dynamic field conditions.The Random Forest model accurately predicted changes in viable E. coli concentrations over time under different agricultural and environmental conditions. Our model also accurately characterized the variability of E. coli concentration in amended soil over time by providing upper and lower prediction bound estimates. Cross‐validation results indicated that our model can be potentially generalized to other geographic regions and incorporated into a risk assessment for evaluating the risks associated with application of untreated BSAAO. Our model can be validated for other regions and predictive performance also can be enhanced when data sets from additional geographic regions become available.},

volume = {70},
year = {2005},
abstract = {The prediction bias (Bf) and accuracy (Af) factors are the most widely used measures of performance of predictive models for food pathogens. However, Bf and Af have limitations that can produce inaccurate assessments of model performance. Consequently, an objective of the current study was to develop a method for quantifying model performance that overcomes limitations of Bf and Af. Performance of published lag time and growth rate models for Salmonella Typhimurium were evaluated for data used in model development and for data not used in model development but that were inside (interpolation) or outside (extrapolation) the response surface of the models. In addition, performance of published models for growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7 was evaluated for data used in model development. Observed and predicted values were compared using Bf, Af, and pRE, a new performance factor that quantified the proportion of relative errors (RE) in an acceptable prediction zone from an RE of‐0.3 (fail‐safe) to 0.15 (fail‐dangerous). A decision diagram based on criteria for test data and model performance was used to validate the models. When Bf and Af were used to quantify model performance, all models were validated. In contrast, when pRE was used to evaluate model performance, 2 models for S. Typhimurium and both models for E. coli O157:H7 failed validation. Overall, pRE was a more sensitive and reliable indicator of model performance than Bf and Af because unacceptable pRE, which indicated a performance problem, were obtained for 8 of 20 evaluations, all of which had acceptable Bf and Af. Alimitation of pRE was the inability to distinguish between global and regional prediction problems. However, when used in combination with an RE plot, pRE provided a complete evaluation of model performance that overcame limitations of Bf and Af.},
