abstract = {Untreated biological soil amendments of animal origin (BSAAO), such as manure, are commonly used to fertilize soils for growing fruit and vegetable crops and can contain enteric bacterial foodborne pathogens. Little is known about the comparative longitudinal survival of pathogens in agricultural fields containing different types of BSAAO, and field data may be useful to determine intervals between manure application and harvest of produce intended for human consumption to minimize foodborne illness. This study generated 324 survival profiles from 12 different field trials at three different sites (UMES, PA, and BARC) in the Mid-Atlantic United States from 2011 to 2015 of inoculated nonpathogenic
(gEc) and attenuated O157
(attO157) in soils which were unamended (UN) or amended with untreated poultry litter (PL), horse manure (HM), or dairy manure solids (DMS) or liquids (DML). Site, season, inoculum level (low/high), amendment type, management (organic/conventional), and depth (surface/tilled) all significantly (
 < 0.0001) influenced survival duration (dpi100mort). Spatiotemporal factors (site, year, and season) in which the field trial was conducted influenced survival durations of gEc and attO157 to a greater extent than weather effects (average daily temperature and rainfall). Initial soil moisture content was the individual factor that accounted for the greatest percentage of variability in survival duration. PL supported greater survival durations of gEc and attO157, followed by HM, UN, and DMS in amended soils. The majority of survival profiles for gEc and attO157 which survived for more than 90 days came from a specific year (i.e., 2013). The effect of management and depth on dpi100mort were dependent on the amendment type evaluated.
Current language in the Food Safety Modernization Act Produce Safety Rule states no objection to a 90- or 120-day interval between application of untreated BSAAO and harvest of crops to minimize transfer of pathogens to produce intended for human consumption with the intent to limit potential cases of foodborne illness. This regional multiple season, multiple location field trial determined survival durations of
in soils amended with manure to determine whether this interval is appropriate. Spatiotemporal factors influence survival durations of
more than amendment type, total amount of
present, organic or conventional soil management, and depth of manure application. Overall, these data show poultry litter may support extended survival of
compared to horse manure or dairy manure, but spatiotemporal factors like site and season may have more influence than manure type in supporting survival of
beyond 90 days in amended soils in the Mid-Atlantic United States.},
